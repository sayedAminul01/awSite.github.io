        <h1>Comparative Prompting: Master the Art of Making Smart Decisions</h1>
        <p>Comparative Prompting is a smart prompt formula used in AI tools like ChatGPT to compare two topics, products, or ideas. It helps break down the similarities, differences, functionality, impact, and more—so you can make informed decisions. In this post, we’ll explain how to use this technique and give you an easy example to understand its power.</p>

        <h2>What is Comparative Prompting?</h2>
        <p>Comparative Prompting is a method of asking an AI to compare two pieces of content side-by-side. You can ask the AI to compare anything—like two business models, two technologies, or two types of investments—and it will show you their similarities, differences, impact, and more in an organized table format.</p>

        <h2>The Prompt Formula</h2>
        <p>Use this format to get detailed results:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Please compare and contrast the following examples. Outline the similarities, differences, functionality, qualitative and quantitative factors, impact, and key takeaways in a table. Here are the two content pieces: [Content A] vs. [Content B].
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Example: Comparing Freelancing vs. Starting a Small Business</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>

                    <th>Freelancing</th>

                    <td>Key Takeaways</td>
                    <td>Great for solo experts who want flexibility</td>
                    <td>Ideal for entrepreneurs seeking scalable growth</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Using comparative prompting saves time and improves decision-making. Instead of doing hours of manual research, you get everything in one place. Whether you're planning a business, choosing an investment, or comparing two products, this technique helps you go deeper with less effort.</p>

        <h2>Tips from SEO Pro</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use keywords like "compare," "difference between," "pros and cons" in your blog post titles.</li>
            <li>Include structured data and semantic HTML (like tables and headings).</li>
            <li>Write clearly with natural language that matches user intent.</li>
            <li>Make your content skimmable using bullet points and formatting.</li>
        </ul>
