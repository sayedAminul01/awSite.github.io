    <h1>I Want You To Act As... — A Powerful Prompting Framework</h1>
    <p>If you're trying to create better prompts for ChatGPT or any AI language model, the <strong>"I Want You To Act As"</strong> framework is one of the most flexible and impactful methods available. This method helps structure your request in a way that tells the AI exactly who it should emulate, what information it will receive, and what the final output should look like.</p>

    <h2>Framework Breakdown</h2>
    <p>This prompt structure can be adapted to any industry or need. Here’s how it works:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>I want you to act as...</strong> – Define a role or persona (e.g., life coach, fitness trainer, language tutor).</li>
      <li><strong>I will give you...</strong> – Provide the AI with content like goals, symptoms, data, or audience info.</li>
      <li><strong>You will then...</strong> – Define the expected output (e.g., create a plan, give advice, write a script).</li>
      <li><strong>In the tone/style of...</strong> – Mention the preferred writing style (friendly, professional, motivational).</li>
      <li><strong>Important details...</strong> – Add critical context (budget, timeframe, dietary restrictions, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>Refine as needed...</strong> – After getting the result, you can ask for adjustments (add formatting, simplify language, emphasize keywords).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example Use Case (Modified)</h2>
    <p>Let’s say you're planning a productivity overhaul. Here’s how you might use the framework:</p>
    <pre style="background:#1e1e1e;padding:15px;border-radius:8px;color:#dbd6d6e7;overflow-x:auto;"><code>I want you to act as a productivity coach.
I will give you my daily schedule and main professional goals.
You will then design a 5-day plan to improve my efficiency.
Use a motivational tone and tabular format.
Important details: I work remotely, have 2 hours of meetings daily, and want to focus more on deep work and task batching.</code></pre>

    <h2>More Example Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Act as a travel planner: Suggest a 7-day itinerary for a solo traveler on a budget.</li>
      <li>Act as a job coach: Review my resume and suggest improvements in a corporate tone.</li>
      <li>Act as a language teacher: Help me improve my spoken Spanish for everyday conversations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Framework Works</h2>
    <p>By clearly defining the role, task, input, and constraints, you're helping the AI reduce ambiguity. This leads to more accurate and usable responses the first time. It's especially helpful for entrepreneurs, marketers, developers, and educators who rely on efficiency and clarity.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Better Outputs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Include all necessary background upfront — don’t make ChatGPT guess.</li>
      <li>Always clarify tone, format, and length preferences.</li>
      <li>Ask follow-up prompts to improve formatting or polish the language.</li>
      <li>Try variations of the same prompt to compare quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>In the next guide, we’ll explore another universal prompt framework with slightly different phrasing but equally powerful results. Stay tuned!</p>
