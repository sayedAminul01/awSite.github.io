        <h1>Understanding Perspective Prompting in AI</h1>
        <p>
            Perspective Prompting is an advanced technique that helps users gain a broader and more nuanced understanding of any topic. Instead of asking a typical question, this method allows you to see the topic from one or more specific viewpoints — encouraging deeper, multidimensional thinking.
        </p>

        <h2>What Is Perspective Prompting?</h2>
        <p>
            Perspective Prompting means asking an AI (like ChatGPT) to answer a question from a specific viewpoint. This can help you better understand complicated issues or learn how different people might see the same situation.
        </p>

        <h2>Two Styles of Perspective Prompting</h2>

        <h3>1. Singular Perspective</h3>
        <p>
            In this format, you ask ChatGPT to explain a topic from one particular point of view. For example:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Prompt Example:</strong> "Explain how to become a successful content creator from the viewpoint of a social media strategist."</p>
        <p>
            This helps you understand strategy, tools, and audience engagement through the eyes of an expert in a specific role.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Multiple Perspectives</h3>
        <p>
            This version allows you to explore multiple viewpoints on the same topic. It's extremely helpful when analyzing controversial or complex issues.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Prompt Example:</strong> "Explain the pros and cons of online learning from the perspectives of a teacher, a student, and a parent."</p>
        <p>
            Each perspective gives unique insights — such as flexibility for students, challenges in engagement for teachers, or screen time concerns for parents.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Use Perspective Prompting?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It deepens understanding by exposing you to more than one view.</li>
            <li>It’s great for brainstorming, research, and storytelling.</li>
            <li>It helps identify biases or gaps in your thinking.</li>
            <li>Ideal for creators, marketers, educators, and researchers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advanced Tips</h2>
        <p>
            You can specify the tone, profession, or mindset in the prompt to get even more tailored results. For instance:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “How can small businesses adapt to remote work? Answer from the perspectives of an HR manager, a tech support engineer, and an employee.”</p>
        <p>
            This not only gives depth but creates actionable points for each stakeholder.
