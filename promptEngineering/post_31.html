    <h1>How to Use Hotkeys in ChatGPT for Lightning-Fast Productivity</h1>

    <p>If you're tired of repeating the same prompts over and over again in ChatGPT, there's great news — you can now create your own <strong>hotkeys using Custom Instructions</strong>. This allows you to personalize your ChatGPT workflow and speed things up dramatically.</p>

    <h2>What Are Hotkeys in ChatGPT?</h2>
    <p>Hotkeys are short trigger phrases (like <code>5q</code> or <code>3i</code>) you set in the <em>Custom Instructions</em> section of ChatGPT. When you type the hotkey into a chat, ChatGPT instantly knows how to respond, without needing you to retype the full prompt each time.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Example (Simplified)</h2>
    <p>Let's say you're working on blog articles. You often need inspiration for titles. Instead of typing "Suggest five catchy blog titles related to the current topic," every single time, just define a hotkey like this in Custom Instructions:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      When I type '5t', please provide five creative blog title ideas based on the topic we’re discussing.
    </div>

    <p>Now, anytime you're chatting with ChatGPT and type <code>5t</code>, you'll immediately get title suggestions.</p>

    <h2>Why Is This Useful?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It saves you time on repeated prompts.</li>
      <li>It keeps your sessions consistent.</li>
      <li>You don’t need to copy/paste or remember long instructions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>More Hotkey Ideas to Try</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3a</strong>: Provide 3 alternative ways to approach this task.</li>
      <li><strong>4p</strong>: Suggest 4 prompt improvements based on my question.</li>
      <li><strong>qz</strong>: Generate a quick quiz based on this topic.</li>
      <li><strong>2ex</strong>: Give 2 real-world examples related to this subject.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Set Up Hotkeys</h2>
    <p>1. Click the three dots (...) in the bottom left corner of ChatGPT.<br>
       2. Select <strong>Custom Instructions</strong>.<br>
       3. In the box "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?", add your hotkey rules.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>You're currently limited to <strong>1,500 characters</strong> in the Custom Instructions box. Prioritize your most useful hotkeys. Consider rotating them out as your needs change.</p>

    <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
    <p>If you work on multiple types of tasks (like writing, coding, teaching), organize your hotkeys with a prefix: <code>w_</code> for writing, <code>c_</code> for coding, etc. For example: <code>w_5t</code> for writing blog titles.</p>

    <p>This small trick helps keep everything easy to manage.</p>
