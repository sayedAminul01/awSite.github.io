    <h1>Understanding AI Models: o1-preview, o1-mini, GPT-4o Mini with Practical Examples</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence models are evolving fast. Among the latest from OpenAI are <strong>o1-preview</strong>, <strong>o1-mini</strong>, and <strong>ChatGPT-4o Mini</strong>. Each one is built with unique strengths. Let's dive into how these models work in real-world tasks like text generation, image handling, code development, and data reasoning — with fresh examples you’ll easily relate to.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Visual Understanding Example</h2>
      <p>Say you want to create an image of a cat climbing a mountain trail. When you use <strong>GPT-4o Mini</strong>, you get a generated image instantly because it supports <strong>multimodal input</strong> — both text and images. You could also upload an image of a product and ask for a description — and it will respond with details immediately.</p>

      <p>However, when you give the same task to <strong>o1-mini</strong> or <strong>o1-preview</strong>, these models will tell you they don’t support image generation. These are pure text-based models focused on reasoning and advanced problem solving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Business Decision Example</h2>
      <p>Imagine you manage a software company looking to expand into the Middle East. You're considering three cities for a new office. You prompt the models for a detailed recommendation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GPT-4o Mini</strong>: Gives a good outline, mentioning potential benefits and challenges for each city. Fast and general.</li>
        <li><strong>o1-preview</strong>: Takes a bit longer but delivers a <strong>thorough comparison</strong> — going into infrastructure, language barriers, competition, and regulatory differences.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Speed & Coding Performance</h2>
      <p>Let’s say you want to build a social web app using Django and React. You ask for full setup instructions including file structure and basic user login features.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>o1-preview</strong>: Responds with great detail — guides you through everything with clear steps.</li>
        <li><strong>o1-mini</strong>: Almost instant reply. It gives the essentials like folder layout and dependencies, ideal when you want to prototype quickly.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Mathematical Problem Solving</h2>
      <p>You need to calculate the cost of pumping 20,000 liters of water to a hill reservoir 120 meters high, at $2 per 10,000 liters. Later, you check the cost for 140 meters.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>o1-mini</strong>: Breaks down the math step-by-step. Explains every operation clearly. Accurate and ideal for students or engineers.</li>
        <li><strong>GPT-4o Mini</strong>: Responds faster, but may <strong>miss additional variables</strong> or cost changes based on different heights.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Which Model to Use & When?</h2>
      <p>Each model fits different purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GPT-4o Mini</strong>: Best for images, quick answers, and mixed content (text + visuals).</li>
        <li><strong>o1-mini</strong>: Ideal for fast text reasoning, coding support, and quick data tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>o1-preview</strong>: Designed for deep analysis, business strategies, and structured technical work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Choosing the right model saves time and improves result quality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Whether you're coding, planning a project, analyzing data, or creating visual content — understanding the strengths of each AI model is key to success. Think of them like tools in a toolbox — the more you know when to use what, the better your results.</p>
