    <h1>Ask Before Answer Prompting Framework</h1>
    <p>One of the most underrated prompt engineering techniques is the <strong>Ask Before Answer</strong> framework. This method encourages ChatGPT (or any AI) to request clarification before generating a final response — making the output far more precise, relevant, and customized to your needs.</p>

    <h2>Why Use Ask Before Answer Prompting?</h2>
    <p>Many users ask questions and get generic results because the AI doesn't have enough context. This framework solves that by making the AI <strong>ask clarifying questions first</strong>, which ensures your final output fits exactly what you want.</p>

    <h2>How It Works – The Formula</h2>
    <p>This is a two-part prompt format that goes like this:</p>

    <div class="example">
      <h3>Part 1 – Set Expectations</h3>
      <p><code>You are an expert in the field of [topic]. I will ask you a task. But before answering, if you have any doubts, ask bullet-point questions to clarify the task. Is that understood?</code></p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <h3>Part 2 – Ask the Question</h3>
      <p><code>Great. My question is: [Insert your question]. Your task is: [Describe the output you want]. Please ask any questions before completing the task.</code></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
    <p>Let's say you want help growing your digital product business. Here’s how you could use this prompt:</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Part 1:</strong><br>
      You are an expert in digital marketing. I will give you a task to help improve my digital product sales. But before you answer, ask bullet-point questions if you're unclear about anything. Do you understand?</p>

      <p><strong>Part 2:</strong><br>
      Great. My question is: How can I increase revenue from my digital downloads? Your task is to provide a 5-step action plan. Ask any clarification questions before answering.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The AI might respond with:</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Before I provide your action plan, I need a few details:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What kind of digital products are you selling?</li>
        <li>Who is your target audience?</li>
        <li>Which platform(s) do you currently sell on?</li>
        <li>Do you already run ads or email campaigns?</li>
        <li>What is your average monthly revenue?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Why This Framework Is Powerful</h2>
    <p>With these answers, the AI can now deliver a tailored, relevant, and actionable plan — instead of a vague one-size-fits-all answer. This method simulates how a real consultant or coach would work with you: they ask before they advise.</p>

    <h2>Pro Tips for Better Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use this method when the task is complex or goal-specific.</li>
      <li>Always invite questions — more context = better results.</li>
      <li>Respond to follow-up questions fully to enhance clarity.</li>
      <li>Pair with other frameworks like "Few-Shot Prompting" for even better outputs.</li>
    </ul>
